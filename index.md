## What is Solar Boat?

Solar Boat is an organization at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School that participates in the [Solar Cup](http://www.mwdh2o.com/inthecommunity/education-programs/Pages/Solar-Cup.aspx), the largest solar-powered boat race in the world.
The competition is sponsored by Metropolitan Water District and consists of two events: sprint and endurance.
Teams at participating schools have 9 months to construct a working solar-powered boat, provide two reports detailing the boat's schematics, and pass inspection to be able to compete.
The competition itself takes place during May at Lake Skinner and goes on for 3 days.

## How does it work?

### Propulsion System
The propulsion system consists of several components: a motor, the drive shaft, a three-bladed prop, a strut, the thrust bearing, gears, and a chain. The motor is connected through a series of gears and a chain to the motor shaft. In order to prevent the shaft from jerking to the point of sinking the boat, a strut is put in place to prevent the drive shaft from making sudden movements. A thrust bearing is connected to the drive shaft in order to effectively transfer all the thrust produced by the propellor linked to the drive shaft to the boat.

### Steering System
The boat is steered through a lever connected by a push-pull rod to a rudder at the back of the boat. The push-pull rod is linked to the lever via a bolt and nut. There is also a linkage assembly that mounts the push-pull rod to the rudder. In order to go left, you need to push the lever forward and backwards to go to the right.

### Electrical System
The electrical system in the boat is a fairly simple series circuit. The essentially components that make it up are the controller, contactor, safety switches, pedal, and the two twelve volt batteries. In order for the boat to actually run, all the safety switches must be activated. These switches are in place so as to prevent the boat’s motor from accidentally turning on. Additionally, there are fuses in place to break the circuit the second the current value gets too high. The contactor is a huge switch that is connected to the pedal in the front of boat that triggers when the pedal is pushed down. Ultimately, this boat’s motor wouldn’t turn at all if it weren’t for the two twelve volt batteries to power it.

More details about how the boat works below in the reports section.

## My History With the Program
I was in the organization for four years. During that time, I went from a regular member to battery manager to co-president. My job as battery manager was to test and maintain the batteries used for the competition. This position taught me how to use a load tester, a device used to simulate real load conditions, to see how long the battery could remain at a working voltage level to power the motor. I picked up on this relatively quickly and was able to easily teach someone else how to manage the system. 

As co-president, my job changed from doing the labor to teaching others how to do it. I taught the newer members how to recognize tools, like screwdrivers, load testers, and multimeters, and how to use them. Since we had new advisors that year, I had to step up to the plate and fill out all the necessary paperwork, such as permission slips and activity clearance forms, in order to be able to participate in the various workshops and the competition itself. I became much more organized and disciplined as a result. 

## Reports 

I oversaw the process of writing experimental reports. I also made circuit diagrams, center of gravity and buoyancy calculations, and edited the report to make sure there were not any mistakes.

I made the following diagrams for the electrical report below using the Digi-Key online circuit maker.

I was drilling a screw into the hull to provide more reinforcement to the overall structure. All of the materials seen were provided at a boat-building workshop sponsored by the Metropolitan Water District. </figcaption> <br>
