## What is Solar Boat?

Solar Boat is an organization at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School that participates in the [Solar Cup](http://www.mwdh2o.com/inthecommunity/education-programs/Pages/Solar-Cup.aspx), the largest solar-powered boat race in the world.
The competition itself consists of two events: sprint and endurance.
Teams at participating schools have 9 months to construct a working solar-powered boat, provide two reports detailing the boat's schematics , and pass inspection to be able to compete.
The competition itself takes place during May at Lake Skinner and goes on for 3 days.

## How does it work?
In order to propel the boat, we utilized a motor mounted to the the boat which rotated a three-bladed propeller. The motor is powered by two twelve volt Odyssey Extreme PC 11000 batteries. Six solar panels are used to charge the batteries in the boat. The motor has several safety switches implemented so that the boat does not turn on by mistake.

## Solar Boat Reports 

I oversaw the process of writing experimental reports. I also made circuit diagrams, center of gravity and buoyancy calculations, and edited the report to make sure there were not any mistakes.
