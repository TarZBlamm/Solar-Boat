## What is Solar Boat?

Solar Boat is an organization at my school that participates in the Solar Cup, the largest solar-powered boat race in the world.
The competition itself consists of two events: sprint and endurance.
Teams at participating schools have 9 months to construct a working solar-powered boat, provide two reports detailing the boat's schematics , and pass inspection to be able to compete.
The competition itself takes place during May at Lake Skinner and goes on for 3 days.


## Solar Boat Reports

While I may not have written the entirety of the reports myself, I oversaw the entire process. I had to step in multiple times to show others how to make circuit diagrams, center of gravity and buoyancy calculations, and edit the report to make sure there were not any mistakes.

I made the following diagrams for the electrical report below using the Digi-Key online circuit maker.
